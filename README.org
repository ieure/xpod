   To create a feed, you need to know the slug of the show, which is
   the last component of the URL for the showâ€™s page.  Example, [[https://xray.fm/shows/sfutf][Songs
   From Under the Floorboard]] =https://xray.fm/shows/sfutf=, so the
   slug is =sfutf=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     xpod {show-slug}
   #+END_SRC

   This will create a ={show-slug}.xml= file containing an Atom feed
   of episodes.
